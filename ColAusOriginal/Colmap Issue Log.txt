Issues:

some map squares have 'Paint backround' as black.

*Fixed*Clicking on a piece does not activate it if is outside the top left
hand corner of the map.

When a players turn commences, there should be an active piece, and the
map should have automatically centred to that point.
*Fixed*

*Fixed*When passing by other pieces the 'animateMove' function does not draw the 
other pieces.

When a piece has no moves left, the display does not switch to the players
next piece until a successful move is applied to that piece...
